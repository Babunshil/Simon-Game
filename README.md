# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a classic memory game that tests your ability to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. This version of the game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features up to 20 levels of increasing difficulty.

# Technologies Used
This game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game logic is implemented using jQuery.

## How to Play

1. Watch and listen carefully as the game plays a sequence of colors and sounds.
2. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
3. If you get the sequence right, the game will play another sequence, this time with one extra color and sound.
4. Keep repeating the sequences correctly to advance through the levels.
5. If you make a mistake, the game will end and you'll have to start over from the beginning.
